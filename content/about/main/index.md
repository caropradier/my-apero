  I'm a PhD Student at the École de Bibliothéconomie et des Sciences de l’Information (Université de Montréal), researching gender inequalities in science through bibliometrics. My work aims to uncover how these disparities shape scientific knowledge.
  
  I hold a degree in Economics and an MSc in Labour Studies from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. As a member of Ecofeminita, I help promote gender equality by sharing data, statistics and academic content. I also contribute to rOpenSci and maintain the eph R package.
